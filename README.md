Welcome to the **Zero to Hero Lab**!  
In this session, you’ll go from setting up your tools to building and sharing code like a pro.  
We’ll start with the basics — VS Code, Git, Python — and then move into a fun **AI Lab** to take things further.

## 🗂 Session Overview

1. **VS Code Basics**  
   - Install VS Code  
   - Explore extensions & terminal  
   - 🧪 *Mini Lab:* Install the **Prettier** extension and format a file

2. **Git Basics**  
   - Learn repositories, commits, branches, push & pull  
   - 🧪 *Mini Lab:* Clone this repository and explore it locally

3. **Python Basics**  
   - Run your first Python script  
   - Understand variables, types, functions  
   - 🧪 *Mini Lab:* Run `main.py` and update it with your own **nerdy/funny message**

4. **Main Lab: Web Application with Git**  
   - Clone a starter repo  
   - Run a Python script that calls an API  
   - Modify the script and push changes with Git

5. **AI Zero to Hero Lab (Advanced)**  
   - Work with a more complex Python script  
   - Use APIs and simple AI features  
   - Includes its own guide: [AI Lab README](./ai-lab/README.md)
